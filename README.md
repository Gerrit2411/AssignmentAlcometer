This code is a React Native application that calculates blood alcohol concentration (BAC) based on input from the user, such as their weight, number of bottles they have consumed, and gender. The app includes input fields for weight, number of bottles, and hours, as well as a radio button for gender. The user can toggle between light and dark themes using a switch, and there is a "CALCULATE" button that triggers the calculation of the BAC. The calculated BAC is displayed on the screen, along with a color-coded text that changes based on the level of the BAC.
